## Data
Some data files are too large to host on Github. Therefore, files that can fit on Github are included here individually, but all files data are also included on Google Drive and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oc26bdlAPJln8gnjE_aZNBsIk-ORqANk?usp=sharing) (requires LionMail).

Both .dat and .csv files can be used to load in the data. They can be used both in mounted Google Drive directory (as in the code .ipynb files) or in local directory.

The file recall_requests.dat can be used to load all the http request responses, to access all the raw html of all the recall pages. Conversely, the other files can be used to directly use the already processed and extracted text data.
